## WARNING
gamerOS is currently an experimental installer script that, when run, results in a minimal Arch Linux system capable of playing Steam games in big picture mode out of the box. The above listed features represent the project goals and are not yet implemented.


## Requirements
 - a wired internet connection
 - **5GB** or larger dedicated hard disk
 - **4GB** or more RAM


## Installation
 - [download](https://www.archlinux.org/download) and boot into the Arch Linux installer
 - make sure you are connected to the internet, consult the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration) for help
 - download the gamerOS install script with the following command:
	`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alkazar/gamer-os/master/install.sh`
 - set executable permissions: `chmod +x install.sh`
 - run `./install.sh <target device>`; for a list of installation targets run `lsblk`
 - once setup is complete, restart the computer
 - after restarting you will be presented with the SteamOS setup wizard and then Steam will start in big picture mode
 - you can open a terminal by using the keyboard combination `ctrl + alt + f2` and log in with username `gamer` and password `gamer`; switch back to big picture mode by pressing `ctrl + alt + f7`
